# Multilingual Next.js Translation Example

 A demo repository for my guest post on the Logrocket blog: [The complete guide to internationalization in Next.js](https://blog.logrocket.com/complete-guide-internationalization-nextjs/)

Application supports **static rendering** and **on-demand** language switching.

The repository will  be kept up to date since I'm using it personally as a starting point for multilingual applications with Next.js
